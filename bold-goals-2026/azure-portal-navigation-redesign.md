## What We're Building
A redesigned navigation experience in the Azure Portal that enables customers to find their resources faster through enhanced search, favorites, recent resources, improved filtering, and better breadcrumb navigation.

## Success Criteria
- **Completion Criteria**: New navigation components deployed to production with feature flags; A/B testing infrastructure in place
- **Success Metrics**:
  - **Time to find resources**: 50% reduction (measured via telemetry on resource navigation paths)
  - **Search success rate**: Increase from baseline (% of searches leading to resource selection)
  - **Customer satisfaction**: CSAT improvement on navigation-related feedback

## Rollout Plan
- **Phase 1** (Week 1): Global search enhancement + Recent resources list
- **Phase 2** (Week 2): Favorites/pinned resources + Resource type filtering
- **Phase 3** (Week 3): Breadcrumb navigation improvements + Integration testing
- **Phase 4** (Week 4): A/B testing rollout + Telemetry validation
- **Validation**: Dogfooding with internal teams → Limited preview with select customers → Gradual production rollout with feature flags
